      <p>When doing these problems, round the final answer to three significant digits. Significant digits are mostly non-zero digits. Zeros are significant digits when they are alone at the end of a decimal (27.0, 5.70), and when inbetween other non-zero digits (101, 1102). If there is only one non-zero digit in a number but has zeros following (100, 2200), you leave the number as is. If there is only one non-zero digit in the entire number, add zeros after the decimal (1 = 1.00). If you round a number up and the number has under three significant digits, that is okay (1999 rounds to 2000). Only round your numbers to significant digits for the answer, all numbers in the equations should be left as the original without rounding.</p>
      <p>Also, when something is falling and you are not given a specific acceleration, assume it is -9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup></p>
