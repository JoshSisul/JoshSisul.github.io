      <p>I would like to visit these places mainly for the scenery. All of these places have great scenery and many things to look at.
        Alaska has many glaciers and mountains with snowy tops. There is a lot of natural beauty found in Alaska with the wildlife and environment. Alaska has many activities like whale watching and fishing. You can also pan for gold at some places in Alaska.
        Egypt has the pyramids and the Nile River. These are an interesting view and there is a lot of history with these landmarks in Egypt. There is also the sphinx that holds a lot of history.
        Hawaii is a group of islands that all have a beautiful view and scenery. The islands of Hawaii have the beaches that can allow people to do many things like surfing.
        The Smithsonian Museum is a huge multi building museum that has many pieces of history. The Smithsonian has a large section on aircraft and airplanes that has a large collection of historic planes on display. I would most be interested in going to the aircraft section of the Smithsonian.
        Washington D.C. has a lot of historical and political importance. There are many historical landmarks like the Washington Monument and the Lincoln. THe White House is also in Washington D.C.
        Yellowstone National Park has a large amount of natural beauty. There is a lot of land that can be explored at Yellowstone.
