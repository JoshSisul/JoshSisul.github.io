        <p>I have shot many different guns throughout my life while never owning one or having one in my house.</p>

      <div class="grid_4 content2">
        <p>The gun that I have shot the most would most likely be my grandfather's double barrel rifle that has a top barrel that shoots a .22 round and the bottom barrel shoots a 20 gauge shotgun round. This gun is a great gun because it holds a lot of utility. It can get small game with a .22 or a 20 gauge buckshot. It can also shoot big game like deer with a 20 gauge slug round. It is also a very reliable and acurate gun that has never failed me all the times I have used it and it was most likely the first gun that I have ever shot.</p>

        <p>The shotgun that I have found the most fun shooting is my grandfather's 20 gauge pump action. This is a fun gun because it has an extremely short barrel and does not have a stock. This gun is shot by guessing where you are aiming from the hip. The 20 gauge rounds are easy to control and due to the short barrel, it can only hold three rounds at a maximum in the barrel. The rifle that I have had the most fun shooting is my grandfather's AR-15. I have had a good time shootig with my grandfather's AR-15 because it is an accurate and fairly easy gun to use. His AR-15 has a thirty round magazine that even when half filled, can last for a little bit if I am shooting for accuracy instead of fast shooting. The two handguns that I have had the most fun shooting are my uncle's Colt 1911 and my grandfather's .22 caliber revolver. The Colt 1911 is one of my favorite guns and while not holding as many rounds as a glock or other 9mm handguns, it packs a big punch with its 45 acp rounds. The .22 revolver is a remake of a Civil War revolver to be used with .22 rounds. The gun is easy to handle and when I am with my grandpa at our family property in Martinsburg, MO, he lets me kep it for the time we are up there and I walk around with it on my belt. The revolver is overall a fun gun to use and is reasonably accurate for a handgun shooting .22 rounds.
