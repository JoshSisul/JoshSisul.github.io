        <p>I have been shooting for most of my life. I think that there is nothing wrong with letting younger people shoot as long as they learn proper gun safety and learn with a gun for their skill level.
        </p>
        <p>While not owning any guns of my own, or having any guns in my house. I have still shot a large amount of different guns. Most have been my grandfather's on my Mom's side, but a few have been from my other grandfather on my Dad's side and only one or two are my Uncle's. One of most interesting guns that I have seen is my Uncle's newest shotgun. It is a 12 gauge pump shotgun but the barrel is rifled instead of smooth. The shotgun can only shoot special 12 gauge slugs that are like rifle bullets. While being a cool and unique gun, the shotgun loses a lot of different uses due to the rifled barrel. I have also gotten the chance to shoot a replica U.S. Civil War black powder musket. I put a hole right through the fish eye on my lucky hat that I take hunting or camping.

        <p>I think that shooting both for sport and for recreation is a very enjoyable experience. As long as the people shooting have learned gun saftey then there should be no problems. I have had many memorable times with shooting and I plan on continuing my time shooting. I hope that I will be able to buy some guns that I am interested in after a few more years and that I will be able to enjoy my experience shooting my own guns.
