    <h1>Welcome to my web page.</h1>

    <h4>(Lets learn HTML!)</h4>

    <p>Before we start let me tel you a little about myself. This is the 1<sup>st</sup> time that I have taught this course. I was born at a very young age and grew in wisdom and grace until now. Of course, I hope to continue to grow in both wisdom and grace but that will require effort tand attention to what is happening in the world and in myself. I hope you learn a lot about web programming and are enlightened by what we do in the class. Good luck!</p>

    <p>When writing web pages you need to make sure that you are attentive to lots of details like the structure and formatting of the page. I want to <b>emphasize</b> to you the importance of this.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>I want to make sure that you understand what I mean so I would like to quote myself.
      <blockquote>It is very important to be aware of all the small details when writing web pages. Afterall, small details can make a big difference. Be conscious of what you are learning and why you are learning it. We will cerainly learn a lot in this class but we must always exert effort to learn.</blockquote>
